Generate PlantUML ACTIVITY diagram for:
""As a site visitor, I want to post comments about articles, so that others can read them.""

 AI Analysis Method: Hugging Face Transformers
- Key Entities: Comments
- Action Verbs: start, process, end
- Relationships: None detected
- Sentiment: NEGATIVE

 Requirements:
1. Start with (*) and end with (*)
2. Represent all main actions as activities in rectangles
3. Use decision diamonds <> for conditional flows
4. Include fork and join for parallel activities
5. Use proper activity flow arrows -->
6. Add swimlanes if multiple actors are involved
7. Include notes and comments for clarity
8. Show error handling and alternative flows

Output Format: Complete PlantUML activity diagram code starting with @startuml and ending with @enduml

Enhanced AI Insight: Focus on modeling the complete workflow with proper activity flow, decisions, and parallel processes as identified by the AI analysis.

Generate PlantUML ACTIVITY diagram for:
""As a Website user, I want to access published FABS files so that I can see the new files as they come in.""

 AI Analysis Method: Hugging Face Transformers
- Key Entities: Website, FABS
- Action Verbs: start, process, end
- Relationships: None detected
- Sentiment: NEGATIVE

 Requirements:
1. Start with (*) and end with (*)
2. Represent all main actions as activities in rectangles
3. Use decision diamonds <> for conditional flows
4. Include fork and join for parallel activities
5. Use proper activity flow arrows -->
6. Add swimlanes if multiple actors are involved
7. Include notes and comments for clarity
8. Show error handling and alternative flows

Output Format: Complete PlantUML activity diagram code starting with @startuml and ending with @enduml

Enhanced AI Insight: Focus on modeling the complete workflow with proper activity flow, decisions, and parallel processes as identified by the AI analysis.

  Comments:
  - Error handling paths cover authentication, service unavailability,
    API errors, subscription failures, and download failures.
  - Alternative flows: password reset, retry vs. cancel, polling fallback.
  - Parallelism: initial file retrieval and notification setup run concurrently.

- Main actions are modeled as activities.
- Decisions (diamonds) handle authentication, connectivity, data presence, and AI success.
- Fork/Join models parallel data retrieval, AI preparation, and UI preparation.
- Error handling: login retries, offline path, missing data, AI failure fallback.
- Sentiment: Positiveâ€”focus on clear, accessible experience for Older Person.

- Action Verbs: start, process, end
- Relationships: None detected
- Sentiment: POSITIVE
- Flow Patterns: decision

 Requirements:
1. Start with (*) and end with (*)
2. Represent all main actions as activities in rectangles
3. Use decision diamonds <> for conditional flows
4. Include fork and join for parallel activities
5. Use proper activity flow arrows -->
6. Add swimlanes if multiple actors are involved
7. Include notes and comments for clarity
8. Show error handling and alternative flows

Output Format: Complete PlantUML activity diagram code starting with @startuml and ending with @enduml

' Additional comments
' - All main actions are modeled as activities (rectangles).
' - Decisions use diamonds via if/then/else.
' - Fork/Join used for AI analysis, integrity checks, and policy derivation in parallel.
' - Swimlanes (partitions) separate User, Application, AI Service, Storage Service, and Security/Compliance.
' - Error handling and alternative flows are included for permissions, upload failures, capacity, malware, and later modification attempts.

Generate PlantUML ACTIVITY diagram for:
""As an Archivist, I want to see Dates and Extents displayed in both the read and edit views for Accessions and/or Resources before the list of Subjects.""

 AI Analysis Method: Hugging Face Transformers
- Key Entities: Resources, Subjects, Extents, Accessions, Archivist, Dates
- Action Verbs: start, process, end
- Relationships: [('precedes', 'Resources', 'The')]
- Sentiment: POSITIVE

 Requirements:
1. Start with (*) and end with (*)
2. Represent all main actions as activities in rectangles
3. Use decision diamonds <> for conditional flows
4. Include fork and join for parallel activities
5. Use proper activity flow arrows -->
6. Add swimlanes if multiple actors are involved
7. Include notes and comments for clarity
8. Show error handling and alternative flows

Output Format: Complete PlantUML activity diagram code starting with @startuml and ending with @enduml

Enhanced AI Insight: Focus on modeling the complete workflow with proper activity flow, decisions, and parallel processes as identified by the AI analysis.

AI Analysis Method: Hugging Face Transformers
Key Entities: Resources, Subjects, Extents, Accessions, Archivist, Dates

Error Handling & Alternative Flows:
- NetIDs validation errors: DDR returns list of unrecognized NetIDs; faculty corrects and retries.
- Date validation errors: DDR rejects invalid ranges; faculty adjusts or cancels.
- Manual removal: Requires explicit confirmation before revocation.
- System-level failures (e.g., DDR outage): display error and allow retry later (not shown in detail).

' Additional notes for clarity
note bottom
- Decision diamonds model conditions (ID provided, authorized, object exists, errors, and components found).
- Fork/Join used twice:
  1) In parallel: permissions validation and object existence check.
  2) In parallel: metadata compilation, stats, and export preparation.
- Error handling covers unauthorized access, object not found, and system errors.
- Swimlanes distinguish actions between Repository Manager and Repository System.

 Swimlanes show responsibilities:
 - Customer: physical inputs/outputs and choices
 - ATM: UI, device control, session, local checks
 - Bank System: authentication, authorization, accounting, audit
 Owner intent: visualize end-to-end withdrawal interactions, including
 decisions (diamonds), parallel activities (fork/join), and error/alternative flows.

- Key Entities: Owner, Library, Borrowing, Book
- Action Verbs: design, process
- Relationships: None detected
- Sentiment: NEGATIVE

 Requirements:
1. Start with (*) and end with (*)
2. Represent all main actions as activities in rectangles
3. Use decision diamonds <> for conditional flows
4. Include fork and join for parallel activities
5. Use proper activity flow arrows -->
6. Add swimlanes if multiple actors are involved
7. Include notes and comments for clarity
8. Show error handling and alternative flows

Output Format: Complete PlantUML activity diagram code starting with @startuml and ending with @enduml

Enhanced AI Insight: Focus on modeling the complete workflow with proper activity flow, decisions, and parallel processes as identified by the AI analysis.

' Notes for clarity and design intent
note across
Owner goal: Design the Purchasing Ticket workflow for the vending machine to model interaction and issuance.
AI Analysis (Hugging Face Transformers): Emphasize robust error handling due to negative sentiment cues.
This diagram includes conditional flows, parallel UI/authorization and backend quoting, and alternative/refund paths.
end note

note right of backend_hold
Backend checks stock/validity and places a short provisional hold
to prevent overselling during selection and payment.
end note

note right of auth_payment
Authorization may be online or offline with floor limits.
Timeouts route to retry/change-method/cancel.
end note

note right of issue_ticket
Issuance covers printed tickets, smartcard encoding, or QR generation.

- Action Verbs: design, process
- Relationships: None detected
- Sentiment: NEGATIVE
- Flow Patterns: decision

 Requirements:
1. Start with (*) and end with (*)
2. Represent all main actions as activities in rectangles
3. Use decision diamonds <> for conditional flows
4. Include fork and join for parallel activities
5. Use proper activity flow arrows -->
6. Add swimlanes if multiple actors are involved
7. Include notes and comments for clarity
8. Show error handling and alternative flows

Output Format: Complete PlantUML activity diagram code starting with @startuml and ending with @enduml

3. Use decision diamonds <> for conditional flows
4. Include fork and join for parallel activities
5. Use proper activity flow arrows -->
6. Add swimlanes if multiple actors are involved
7. Include notes and comments for clarity
8. Show error handling and alternative flows

Output Format: Complete PlantUML activity diagram code starting with @startuml and ending with @enduml

- Action Verbs: design, design
- Relationships: None detected
- Sentiment: NEGATIVE

 Requirements:
1. Start with (*) and end with (*)
2. Represent all main actions as activities in rectangles
3. Use decision diamonds <> for conditional flows
4. Include fork and join for parallel activities
5. Use proper activity flow arrows -->
6. Add swimlanes if multiple actors are involved
7. Include notes and comments for clarity
8. Show error handling and alternative flows

Output Format: Complete PlantUML activity diagram code starting with @startuml and ending with @enduml

Enhanced AI Insight: Focus on modeling the complete workflow with proper activity flow, decisions, and parallel processes as identified by the AI analysis.

- Fork/join used to gather evidence and run quality gates in parallel.
- Error handling includes rollback, escalation, and rework loops.
- Swimlanes separate human (Owner) and automated (System) responsibilities.

- Key Entities: Selection, Manager, Product
- Action Verbs: design, process
- Relationships: None detected
- Sentiment: NEGATIVE
- Flow Patterns: decision

 Requirements:
1. Start with (*) and end with (*)
2. Represent all main actions as activities in rectangles
3. Use decision diamonds <> for conditional flows
4. Include fork and join for parallel activities
5. Use proper activity flow arrows -->
6. Add swimlanes if multiple actors are involved
7. Include notes and comments for clarity
8. Show error handling and alternative flows

Output Format: Complete PlantUML activity diagram code starting with @startuml and ending with @enduml

Enhanced AI Insight: Focus on modeling the complete workflow with proper activity flow, decisions, and parallel processes as identified by the AI analysis.

' Additional clarity notes
note bottom
- Decision diamonds denote conditional flows and alternatives.
- Fork/join used for parallel preparation: taxes, shipping, inventory hold, and fraud check.
- Error handling covers: invalid cart, invalid address, out-of-stock, tax/ship service failure, fraud failure, and payment decline.
- Swimlanes represent actors: Customer, Web/App System, Payment Gateway/Risk, Inventory & Order Mgmt, Shipping Service.

Goal: A secure and user-friendly login process with defense-in-depth.
Highlights:
- TLS enforcement, CSRF protection, anti-automation
- Rate limiting and risk assessment in parallel
- Timing-safe, generic errors (no user enumeration)
- MFA when enabled, robust audit logging and SIEM monitoring

' Security implementation notes
note over A
- Use prepared statements/ORM; sanitize inputs; avoid injection.
- Passwords stored as salted Argon2id/bcrypt with strong parameters.
- Timing-safe compare for credentials and tokens.
- Generic errors for all auth failures to prevent enumeration.
- Exponential backoff and account lockout with secure recovery.
end note

note over C
- Enforce HTTPS; refuse mixed/insecure contexts.
- Include CSRF tokens on state-changing requests.
- Do not persist passwords; use secure input fields and memory.

' Additional global notes
note bottom
- All communications must be over TLS; apply HSTS and secure cookie flags.

- Apply CAPTCHA or proof-of-work adaptively after repeated failures.
- Centralized logging to SIEM enables the Security Analyst to monitor and respond.

  Security Principles:
  - Use HTTPS/TLS everywhere; set HSTS.
  - Avoid user enumeration via consistent error messages.
  - Apply rate limiting, lockouts, and CAPTCHA as needed.
  - Use strong password hashing (Argon2/bcrypt/scrypt) with unique salt and optional pepper.
  - Log and monitor all auth events; alert on anomalies.
